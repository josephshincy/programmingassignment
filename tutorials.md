this tutorial we will be using git on the command line only.
 While there are some great git GUIs (graphical user interfaces),
 I think it's easier to learn git using git-specific commands first 
and then to try out a git GUI once you're more comfortable with the command.
easily provided the comments that we hve to done before pushing to the back up in git.basic comments in git bash are also seen.it is helpfull for the students that the git hub itself has a tutorial that show stnhe each comments use for the git hub.
